			<p>I was the lead front-end developer on the BBC GoodFood responsive redesign.</p>
			<p>Lasting around 10 months, I worked closely with the team at BBC Worldwide to create a beautiful new experience that works across devices.</p>

			<p>Developed in partnership with <a href="https://twitter.com/mrmartineau" rel="external">Zander Martineau</a> at TMW, Kickoff is a robust, adaptable and unopinionated front-end framework that is great starting point for any web site; we use it on all of our front-end projects at TMW.</p>
			<p>The framework includes a SASS-based, CSS framework (with all the usual resets and mixins), a responsive grid system; beautiful typographic styles; javascript plugins, utilities and a great set of boilerplates for most eventualities. This means that our devs can get up and running as quickly as possible and not have to worry about this tedious initial step.</p>

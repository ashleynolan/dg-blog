- Password cannot be longer than 10 characters


XSS Attack
Hijacking search forms, through inserting JS into the page.  Works on sites that use things like ?search=

Could make a request by using an img path to make a request (with any cookie info in).
- Can use document.cookie to get the auth code of anyone who clicks your link

Way to stop it = encoding for JS/HTML so that any text coming in gets encoded and not output as code.

- Check out the OWASP XXS Filter Evasion Cheat Sheet

'); console.log(document.cookie); $('#searchTerm').val('Hello

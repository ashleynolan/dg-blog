# {{ title }}

After seemingly months of 'finishing touches', the redesign of my blog, Dragon Graphics, has finally been pushed out into the world to fend for itself.

For those of you wondering who I am, check out the brief history of me.  For those who don't have the time/inclination, I specialise in front-end web technology, but my passion is all things web, and so the content of the site will reflect that.  I'm also hoping to open up a labs section of the site in the not too distant future which will look to be more hands on code samples - everything from simpler CSS3 demos, to more in-depth canvas and WebGL examples.

Thanks must go to a few friends who kindly volunteered their skills to help me fill in the gaps.  Kudos goes out to [Andrea Philippou](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/andrea-philippou/2/69a/823) for creating my beautifully designed logo, [Ed Richards](http://twitter.com/#!/eboyrichards) for knocking up some great base designs on which the rest of the site has been styled on top of, and [Owain Llewellyn](http://twitter.com/#!/owzzz) for giving extra design advice when required.  A mega thank you to all of them.

It would be great to hear what people think of the site - good or bad - so do get in touch in the comments or look me up on Twitter.

Cheers,

Ash

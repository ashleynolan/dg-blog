I'm not usually one for indulging in posts about myself, but I really enjoyed reading Remy's [short history](http://remysharp.com/about/) on his site when I was starting out, so I'm going to firmly put the blame on him for this post...!

So, hello - I'm Ashley Nolan.  I currently work as a Creative Technologist for [TMW](http://www.tmw.co.uk/), which involves me trying to find cool ways of fitting creative tech into our work, as well as ensuring other departments know where front-end development is headed.

I'm originally from South Wales, more accurately a little village named [Caerleon](http://www.caerleon.net/) pretty close to the border, which is my excuse for having no trace of a Welsh accent (other than after a few pints).  From an early age, my passion was digital - games were my first love and this evolved into a passion for all visually compelling aspects of digital (insert your own joke here).

I left home in 2002 to study Computer Science at the [University of Bath](http://www.bath.ac.uk/).  During my 3rd year at uni I got my first role; a placement year at [The Learning Eye](http://www.thelearningeye.com/).  I was a part of a small team, which meant I got to work on some really great projects, creating learning materials for Toyota, Lexus and BMW.  I also got my first taste of 3D, playing with modelling effects in 3D Studio Max.

Upon realising that work was about to shackle me to the responsibilities of real life once graduating, I decided to do the sensible thing and set off for 10 months of travelling around Canada and North America instead, spending 5 months in Whistler pretending to be a pro skier.

When I returned home, I discovered I needed money to pay for things like food, and fell into a job as a PHP and SQL junkie working for a fairly unpopular insurance price comparison website on a wage that can best be described as 'crap'.  The dream was to move to London as soon as I could and work agency side; 9 months later I got my chance, being hired by [Precedent](http://www.precedent.co.uk/); an established agency based near Liverpool Street.

I learned much of my grounding in front-end development during my 3 years at Precedent, before deciding that I wanted to focus solely on front-end development, moving to [Momentum](http://momentumww.co.uk/) in April 2011.  I got to work on some incredibly innovative campaigns at Momentum in the 12 months I was there, including projects for Xbox and Sony PS3, as well as making full use of having Rowntree's as a client by eating virtually my own weight in fruit pastilles.

That brings you up-to-date; I feel incredibly lucky to have worked alongside people who I consider to be among the most talented in our industry.  I'm still as excited, if not more so, by the state of the web today and the challenges it offers up.

The web community has provided so many free resources to me since I got into the industry, which is part of the reason for creating this blog; hopefully now I can give a little back - or something that sounds a little less righteous anyway!

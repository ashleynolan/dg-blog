Over the next couple of months, I'll be doing a new talk I've written called ‘Know Thy Interaction’ at a few different events.

Tonight, it will be it's first run-out at [Shropgeek Rebellion](http://www.shropgeek.co.uk/events/rebellion-6-22-5-14/), up in Shrewsbury.  As the title suggests, the talk covers interaction and how design interaction has and is changing on the web at the moment.

During the talk, I show quite a few examples, and reference even more, so I just wanted to put all of the links in one place for those that see the talk and want a reference for the links, or for anyone who is interested in what is being covered but isn't lucky enough to get to see the talk in person ;)

The slides are [available online](http://www.slideshare.net/nolly00/know-thy-interaction-how-interaction-is-changing-what-we-create-on-the-web) and here are the accompanying links.

## TMW Open Source Work

Last year, I wrote a post about [Playing around with the CSS text-shadow property](/blog/playing-around-with-css-text-shadow).

Well, handily the folks at Webucator have produced a video tutorial based on my post which is now [available to view on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48Y9D6uH_Tc&feature=youtu.be).

Webucator have a bunch of [CSS training resources](https://www.webucator.com/webdesign/css.cfm) – both free and paid for – so if you think they could be useful for you, check them out.

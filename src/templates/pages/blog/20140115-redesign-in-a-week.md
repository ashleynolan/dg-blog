I‘m pretty awful at setting myself soft deadlines.  Unless there‘s a solid deadline which people are relying on me to hit, I can procrastinate like nobodies business.

Case in point; the last time I redesigned this site.  What should have taken a few weeks to develop ended up dragging on for longer than I‘d even like to consider.  The problem with this is that the only person it affects is yourself.  Having many open side projects can be somewhat self defeating; personally I‘m far better when focussed, completing the task and then moving on.

Just before Christmas I decided it was time for a site refresh.  The old site was fine and could have lasted a while longer, but having my content in a CMS made no sense; it simply put too much baggage in the way of me actually writing.  I wanted to remove as many of the potential barriers as I could so that I minimised any excuses I could think up.

When I went back to work in January, I made myself a deal. I had a free week of evenings. I would therefore try to turn around the resdesign in a week. No time to drag my feet, no time for procrastination. Just enough time to do it.

To compete against myself I needed to lay down a couple of rules.  The first self imposed rule was not to sweat the detail.  In the past, I‘ve been my own worse enemy. Trying to perfect absolutely every detail of a design is fine in some cases, but when redesigning my own personal site it‘s a match made in hell.  Therefore, if I hit a fork where there was a choice between a simple or a more complex route, I would take the simple route.  No pouring hours into something that doesn't help me hit my goal. Focus on the main features, then iterate.

The second rule was to design almost solely in the brower, mobile first.  I figured this would be quicker than trying to mock things up first.  In terms of the design goal, I wanted to refresh not overhaul the whole site design.  Having recently dived a bit deeper into actually designing myself, I wanted to chance my arm and see where that took me.  Personally, I found designing in the browser lead to e making design decisions faster.  Being able to try small things out before deciding the direction I'd actually go with and see how it actually responded at differnet widths was refreshingly easy.


In terms of what I wanted the site to be built on, I needed my content to be more easily transferrable, not hard baked in to a CMS.  I write my posts in Markdown, so it made sense to have them stored like that on my site and parsed into HTML.  Therefore, I chose to use Assemble, a static site generator similar in nature to Jekyll, but far less blog focussed and more flexible if I choose to extend it down the line.

So how did it go? Any possibility of suspense may have been ruined by the sites new design I‘d have thought…

8 days after starting, the redesign is done. I spent around 4 evenings and a Saturday in terms of actual time spent and although it‘s taken up most of my last week, it feels good that it‘s moved forward so much in a relatively short space of time.

My blog content is now all in Markdown which removes potential excuses when I think about writing a post.  Sure, there are things I want to improve upon, but I'm much more happy with the site now than I was 8 days ago. Plus noone will notice the things I know aren‘t there for precisely that reason; they aren‘t there.

But the single piece of advice I‘d give anyone else who, like myself, feels they struggle to finish their own personal projects.

**Don‘t sweat the detail.**

Think about your options, but recognise when you are digging yourself a bigger hole instead of simply moving forward.  If your main goal is to get a site out with feature x, don‘t spend days playing around with feature y if it holds up feature x.  Complete feature x, release, and make new goals for feature y.  It‘s what all the great companies have done in the past to ensure they focus their priorities and their time, and it works the same across any project, irrespective of scale.

I had to pull myself away from it a couple of times, but I can see why it was important to now.  Spending too much time thinking about what‘s missing from what you‘re building detracts from what you‘ve already created.

So give that the focus it deserves first before moving onto new goals.

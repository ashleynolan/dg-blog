The Front-End Tooling Survey is back to shed some light on our tooling habits across the web development industry.

Towards the end of 2016, 5,254 developers took part in the previous survey with [the results showing some interesting changes](blog/frontend-tooling-survey-2016-results) in the tools that people were using.

Back then, React knowledge across the industry had rocketed, while Sass was still by far the most popular CSS preprocessor.  Meanwhile tools like Vue.js, Jest and PostCSS were starting to see growing adoption over the previous 12 months.

But how have things changed (or not) since then?  What tools are we using right now and how does that compare with the results from 2016?  And are there new tools emerging that would be useful to keep an eye on?

## What’s new?

Based on feedback, I’ve added questions on CSS frameworks and JavaScript Type checking to see which tools are top of the pile in those areas.

Also new in this year’s survey is a question aimed at learning knowledge levels around some of the newest CSS techniques being used, such as CSS Grid and Custom Properties.

Otherwise the survey has been kept as concise as usual — so the familiar questions tweaked to include any new tools that are seemingly becoming more popular with developers.

## Take part!

As with previous years, I've tried to keep the survey as short as possible – it should only [take a few minutes to fill in](http://ashn.uk/survey-2018) – and I really do appreciate every response.

With that in mind, please share the survey with any other front-end developers you know or work with – quite simply, the more responses the survey has, the more representative the results will be.

The survey will close in about a month, after which I'll write up the results and analysis as a series of articles.  If you'd like to know when this happens, [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/AshNolan_) or you can leave your email at the end of the survey to receive information once this has been published.

So what are you waiting for?! [Go ahead and fill in the survey now](http://ashn.uk/survey-2018)!

I'm not usually one for indulging in posts about myself, but I really enjoyed reading Remy's [short history](http://remysharp.com/about/) on his site when I was starting out, thus making him directly responsible for this post!

So, hello - I'm Ashley Nolan.  I currently work as a Creative Technologist for TMW, pushing their front-end and digital creative output.  From an early age, my passion was digital - games were my first love and this evolved into a passion for all visually compelling aspects of digital (insert your own joke here).

I'm originally from the green, green grasslands of South Wales, more accurately a little village named [Caerleon](http://www.caerleon.net/).  I left home in 2002 to study Computer Science at the [University of Bath](http://www.bath.ac.uk/).

During my 3rd year at uni I took my first role; a placement year at [The Learning Eye](http://www.thelearningeye.com/).  As part of a small team, I worked on some really great projects, creating learning materials for Toyota, Lexus and BMW.  I also got my first taste of developing in 3D, creating models in 3D Studio Max.

Upon realising that work was about to shackle me to the responsibilities of real life, I decided to escape the inevitable and set off for 10 months of travelling around Canada and North America, spending 5 months in Whistler pretending to be a pro skier.

Returning home, I then attempted to get onto the digital agency bandwagon - quickly discovering how hard it was to get an agency role with no previous agency experience; that old catch 22.  Trying to up my experience, I got a role with a fairly unpopular insurance price comparison website, as a PHP and SQL junkie - on a wage that can best be described as 'crap'.

The dream was to move to London as soon as I could and work agency side. 9 months later I got my break, being hired by [Precedent](http://www.precedent.co.uk/); an established agency based near Liverpool Street.

I learned much of my grounding in front-end development during my 3 years at Precedent, before deciding that I wanted to focus solely on my front-end work, moving to Momentum in April 2011.  I got to work on some incredibly innovative campaigns at Momentum in the 12 months I was there, including work for Xbox and Sony PS3.

Which brings you up-to-date; working at TMW as a Creative Technologist.  I've been incredibly lucky to work with, and meet, people who I consider to be among the most talented in our industry.

I am still as excited, if not more so, by the state of the web today and the challenges it offers those that seek them out.  Over the coming years I want to push on, creating great digital work as well as giving back to the community which I've learned a great deal from over the years.

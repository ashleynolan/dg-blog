Over 4,500 developers have taken part in this year's survey so far!  A huge thank you to everyone who has filled it in and helped to spread the news.

I'll be closing the survey at the end of March (this weekend), so if you haven't taken part, I'd really appreciate it if you could [spend 5 minutes filling it in now](http://ashn.uk/survey-2018).

## Can You Help?

I've been humbled by the incredible response so far and it would be amazing if we could push past 5,000 responses before the survey closes.

If you could share the survey with those you know it would mean the world to me â€” whether that is a tweet, a facebook share, or just pinging a few friends on slack.

Here's a couple of quick links:

## A Big Thank You

Thanks again for your continued support and I'll be in touch with the results next month! :)

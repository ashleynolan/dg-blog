**TL;DR**: If you can spare a few minutes of your time to fill out the [2016 Front-End Tooling Survey](http://ashn.uk/survey-tooling-2016), I would massively appreciate it.

After an _incredible_ response to the Front-End Tooling Survey I ran last year – a fantastic **2028 responses** – I thought it would be interesting to repeat the survey a year on to find out how our tooling has moved on (or perhaps hasn’t in some cases).

The focus of the survey is the same as last year; **To find out more details about the tools front-end developers are currently using in their own workflows**.  It’s all too easy to take for granted what people are using based on your own knowledge and this survey gives an insight into the current trends in front-end tooling from a broader perspective.

Once you have taken the time to fill in the survey yourself, it would be a massive help if you could also share it with other front-end developers that you know – quite simply, the more respondents the survey has, the more representative the results will be.

I’m aiming to run the survey for up to a month, after which I’ll write up the results right here on my blog.  Keep an eye on my [Twitter ramblings](https://twitter.com/AshNolan_) for the link to this when it’s published.

So what are you waiting for?! [Fill in the Survey right now](http://ashn.uk/survey-tooling-2016)!

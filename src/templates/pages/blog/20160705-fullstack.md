Next week, I’m excited to be making the short trip down the M4 to speak at FullStack 2016 in London.

I’ll be talking about 'Developing for the Unknown' and how keeping this in mind has influenced the work that I’ve been a part of over the last year at JUST EAT.  Ultimately, the aim of my talk is to get more developers thinking about the long term implications of the work they do – something that I plan to write about in more detail in the near future.

So if you want to hear about how we approach front-end development at JUST EAT and some of the best practices I recommend when working with CSS and JavaScript, then my talk is most definitely for you.

I’m personally looking forward to learning more about the latest developments around developing progressive web applications and how other companies – such as the BBC – are building scalable JavaScript applications and the processes that they are using that can help inform the work that we do.

## Come along

If you work with JavaScript and you’re based in and around London (or fancy making the trip down), be sure to [check out the full lineup for the event](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/7278-fullstack-2016-the-conference-on-javascript-node-and-internet-of-things#overview) – it looks like it should be a great few days!

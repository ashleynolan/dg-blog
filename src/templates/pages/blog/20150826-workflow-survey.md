So I’m going to get straight to the point.

If you could spare 2 minutes of your time to fill out a *very brief* [survey I’m running on front-end tools](http://ashn.uk/survey-tooling), I would massively appreciate it.

*"What’s with the survey?"*, I hear you cry!

Well I’d like to find out which tools front-end developers are currently using in their own workflows – it’s easy to take for granted what people are using based on your own knowledge and this survey should hopefully give a small insight into the current trends in front-end tooling from a broader perspective.  I’ll be writing up the results as a future post, as well as detailing my findings in a talk I’m planning to do on the state of modern front-end tooling.

The survey is a number of very short multiple choice questions and should take less than a couple of minutes to answer, so if you could fill it in – as well as passing it on and sharing it with other front-end developers that you know – I’d be really grateful.

As an incentive, at the end of [the survey](http://ashn.uk/survey-tooling) there will be a big party with [cake for everyone](http://theportalwiki.com/wiki/Cake)*.

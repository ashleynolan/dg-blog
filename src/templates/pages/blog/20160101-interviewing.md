One of my [former bosses](https://twitter.com/TheG) once told me that even if you aren’t actively looking for a job, it’s a good idea to go to a job interview once in a while to keep yourself sharp.

Having recently changed job myself, I can now see what he meant.  Interviewing for the first time in over 3 years was tough; the best jobs are – pretty obviously – looking for the best devs and the interview process can be very rigourous.

One of my [former bosses](https://twitter.com/TheG) used to tell me that even if you aren’t actively looking for a job, it can be a good idea to go along to a job interview once in a while to keep yourself sharp.

Having very recently changed job myself, I can now see what he meant.

Interviewing for the first time in over 3 years was tough.  Although, as web developers, we’re very lucky to be working in an industry in which there are plenty of jobs available, the very best roles are – pretty obviously – looking for the very best devs and the interview process can be fairly rigourous.

So I wanted to share my recent experiences and in doing so hopefully help others better prepare for any front–end interviews they have in the future.  Although my observations come from interviewing for front–end positions, some of my points are relevant when applying for any web–related position.


## Be prepared

As someone who has led interviews in the past, I can say just how difficult it is to judge exactly how good a developer is from simply talking to them.

Interviewers only get to see a brief snapshot of you and your work, This is especially true with the common first stage of many applications now being a phone interview; unfortunately no matter how good you may be when actually writing code, if you can’t answer basic front–end questions, then chances are the interview won’t go very well.

The problem with this is that developers rarely have to explain the basics in their day–to–day jobs; how many times recently have you had to explain out loud the difference between using `position: relative`, `position: absolute` and `position: fixed`?  My guess would be not very often.  This is a fundamental piece of knowledge for any front–end developer, but ensuring you can effectively explain knowledge like this is key, as chances are you’ll be asked a number of these kind of questions.

Here are a few examples of JavaScript questions I got asked recently:

- Explain the concept of closure and what it is used for
- What does the `$` represent when using jQuery?
- Explain the `this` keyword and it’s behaviour in JS
- What is the difference between the `DOMContentLoaded` and `window.load` events?
- Give a brief explanation of the JavaScript frameworks that I know of or have used and give examples of the kind of projects that they are best suited towards

Whereas HTML/CSS questions included:

- What is a normal HTTP request made up of?
- Explain the box-model and how it affects various CSS properties
- What is the difference between `display: block`, `display: inline` and `display: inline-block`?
- What is BEM and explain why using something like it could be useful in your CSS?
- Describe some of the steps you might take to ensure your website is accesible

These are all things that are front–end developers are expected to be able to explain.  The HTML5 boilerplate team maintain a [more exhaustive list](https://github.com/h5bp/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions) of possible interview questions for front–end devs – I highly recommend checking it out.

Many of the these pieces of knowledge most of us use every day, but actually being able to explain this knowledge to someone else is something that should definitely be practiced before any interview.


## Basic CS knowledge

This is one aspect of the interviews that took me a little by surprise, and that was the emphasis on basic Computer Science knowledge.

One interview in particular took this area very seriosuly.  While on a live coding interview – taking place on Skype – they expected me to be able to explain the complexity of the JavaScript code I was writing using O notation and then be able to offer alternatives that may improve upon that complexity.

I’m lucky to have a background in Computer Science from my degree, but having been a front–end dev for over 10 years, I have never placed too much emphasis on how much or little of that knowledge a front–end developer has.  It can definitely be very useful, especially

previously completing I can honestly say that this was never something I would need

The role of a front-end developer has changed massively since I started out in the industry.

Whereas in the past front-end developers could get away with knowing very little about design, it's now very important to, at the very least, know the basic fundamentals and principles of design.  Some developers are equally skilled in design as they are in front-end coding, capable of creating great looking sites on their own.

Having originally come from a more technical Computer Science background, Iâ€™m still learning my trade in design.  When I started out in front-end development I always felt that I had a 'good eye' for a design, but without ever really knowing the underlying principles to back it up; Why did

On many of the projects I now work on, I take great pride in collaborating closely with our designers to create a great design together, but this wouldn't have been possible without first learning some of the fundamental skills and techniques that I think all front-end developers should know.

It’s that time of the year when it can be nice to take a quick breather, look back and reflect on the achievements of the last 12 months.

Professionally, 2014 has been very good to me.  I finally [redesigned this site](blog/sweating-the-detail) into something I’m not ashamed of, the front-end team at TMW has continued to grow and I’ve had the chance to learn a whole host of new skills as front-end development continues to explode into exciting and unforeseen areas.

So I wanted to take look over some of the things I’ve been focussing on this last year and documenting their progress.  That way when 2015 comes to a close, I can look back and see how things have moved on.

## Open–source work

During 2014, I made a concious effort to try to give back as much as I can to the community through open source and writing.  I love how active our community is, writing and speaking about our work in order for others to learn.  Having been mostly self-taught myself, I know how important this is for those starting out in the industry and to push the whole of our community forward.

Personally, it’s been great to see a couple of the projects I help maintain grow throughout the year.

Kickoff, the lightweight front-end framework I help maintain with Zander Martineau, was originally created to create consistency between the front-end projects our team works on at TMW.  It has now been starred by 201 developers on Github and we recently launched V4, in which we heavily worked on the site documentation.  We have plenty of plans to grow the framework as a tool in the future, as well as continuing to develop it as the front-end landscape continues to change – if you’re looking for something a little more lightweight than Bootstrap or Foundation, it could be worth checking Kickoff out.

Late in 2014, I revised the front-end guidelines I wrote when first starting at TMW.  Somehow, they now sit atop Google when searching for 'front-end guidelines' and have been viewed over 11 thousand times since the start of November when I started tracking the analytics.

I’ve also written a tool – [Statix](https://github.com/tmwagency/statix) – that helps make creating HTML templates much easier.  I find it incredibly useful when creating front-end templates or very simple sites which share markup across pages, but don’t require a full-blown CMS.  Hopefully in 2015 I’ll get chance to more thoroughly document it like we have done with Kickoff.


## Writing and speaking

My main goal for 2014 was to write more on my own site; it’s something I really enjoy doing, and I like how tangible the response can be when receiving feedback on the pieces I write.

During 2014, I have written 13 posts on this site, as well as a few times on the [TMW tech blog](http://tech.tmw.co.uk/).  I think it should be an achievable goal to beat that number in 2015.

In terms of growth, this site has gone from 1,973 page views in 2013, to 38,561 in 2014, with the most popular post being [Writing CSS that doesn’t suck](/blog/writing-css-and-sass-that-doesnt-suck), with 11,440 views.

In terms of speaking, 2014 was a quieter year than 2013.  Writing a talk takes up a mammoth amount of time when compared to writing articles or code demos, and front-end speaking is a hugely competitive area right now.  As much as I do want to speak more, it can be hard to justify spending weeks on a talk to only give it at one event.  This is however an area I would love to expand on, and I’ll still be firing off the talk proposals for events should people be interested in hearing what I have to talk about!

## Code demos

Making code demos is really great fun – I absolutely love CodePen, and I’ve been lucky enough to have a couple of my demos do fairly well on there this year.

[Media Query Mario](http://codepen.io/ashleynolan/pen/rpjHg) has been viewed over 55,000 times as of this writing, and the [3D button effect demo](http://codepen.io/ashleynolan/pen/djpCG) I knocked together has had 16,000+ views and over 450 hearts.  Pretty incredible.

I also tried my hand at deploying my own Node.JS site in time for Christmas, [ChristmasTracker](http://www.christmastracker.com/), with the site getting decent feedback and the CodePen demo being viewed over 10,000 times.

I’ve got a whole host of ideas to put up in 2015, so if you like that kind of thing, keep your eyes peeled for more code demos in the coming months.


## Goals for 2015

If I can continue the great feedback I’ve had during 2014 through the next 12 months, I’d be a very happy guy.

I have a number of projects that I’ve been meaning to write about for quite a while, so writing them down will be my first task of 2015.

I’ve also become quite obsessed with using Node.JS for realtime data, and so working on more projects in that kind of realm would be awesome.

I do want to focus more on writing and code demos through 2015 though.  I find that I learn the most when working on those areas, as well as getting the most pleasure from working on them.

## Your turn…

So that’s my year in review – how about yourself?  What have you achieved in 2014?

If you haven’t done so already, take a few moments and think about the work you’ve done throughout 2014, setting yourself some rough goals for the year ahead.

Happy New Year!

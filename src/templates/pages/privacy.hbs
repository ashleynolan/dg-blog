Privacy Policy
March 27, 2018

In the interest of being completely transparent and open, this privacy policy explains generally how we (that is AshleyNolan.co.uk) receive information about you, and what we do with that information once we have it.

### What do we mean by "personal information?"

For us, "personal information" means information which identifies you, like your email address.

Any information that falls outside of this is "non-personal information."

If we store your personal information with information that is non-personal, we will consider the combination as personal information. If we remove all personal information from a set of data then the remaining is non-personal information.

### How do we learn information about you?

We learn information about you when:

- you provide it directly (e.g. when you fill in the annual front-end tooling survey);
- you browse this website.  This information is anonymous and collected through Google Analytics

### What do we do with your information once we have it?

When you give us information, we will use it only in the ways for which you've given us permission.

With regard to personal information given when filling out our surveys, this is only used to communicate with you about future news or surveys.  You can opt out of this communication at any point.

Non-personal data collected through analytics tools are used to monitor how users are engaging with the website.

### When do we share your information with others?

Your personal information is never shared with anyone else.

Non-personal information given to us (e.g. through our surveys) is only shared as combined statistics as explained when collecting that information.

### How do we store and protect your personal information?

No personal data is stored by us.  Email addresses collected are stored by our email service provider and only used to communicate with you in the ways specified.

We also don't want your personal information for any longer than we need it, so we only keep it long enough to do what we collected it for.


### What else should you know?

We use service providers whose computers may be in various countries. This means that your information might end up on one of those computers in another country, and that country may have a different level of data protection regulation than yours. By giving us information, you consent to this kind of transfer of your information. No matter what country your information is in, we comply with applicable law and will also abide by the commitments we make in this privacy policy.

If you are under 13, we don't want your personal information, and you must not provide it to us. If you are a parent and believe that your child who is under 13 has provided us with personal information, please contact us to have your child's information removed.

### What if we change this privacy policy or any of our privacy notices?

We may need to change this policy and our notices. The updates will be posted online. Your continued use of this website after the effective date of such changes constitutes your acceptance of such changes. To make your review more convenient, we will post an effective date at the top of the page.

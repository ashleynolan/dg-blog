#Designing responsively is a craft

* Talk about how RWD has kicked on.
* How reading about designing for RWD just isn't cutting it
* The problems with idealistic approach
	* Clients love mockups
	* Prototypes are time consuming
	* Designing in the browser hinders design creativity and specificity - designers should lose their attachment to pixel perfect, but why not start there and get as close to it as possible

Responsive Web Design (RWD) has changed the way we all think about designing and developing websites.  I'm a massive fan of the RWD approach (who isn't?!), following it's uptake over the last 18 months, while actively working on RWD projects over the last year or so.

Back in June, I started work on the most challenging RWD project I've been a part of to date.  It wasn't a requirement to be responsive, but the site had to work across multiple devices.  We looked at the possibility of building separate mobile and desktop codebases, but the value of making it work responsively outweighed any pitfalls, and so it was decided we'd take a responsive approach unless we hit such a roadblock as to compromise the project.

I didn't consider myself new to responsive back in June by any means, but tackling larger RWD issues really helped focus you on potential problems for future responsive site builds. are a few things that I've noticed since moving from these smaller responsive builds onto a full blown, large scale build, which will feed back into any future RWD work I'm a part of.


##Prototyping is key

Coming from an agency background, I know how hard it can be to get time to spend on something that isn't always easily quantifiable in terms of its value, especially on projects where budgets and time are at a premium.  The true value of prototyping on a RWD project is through what fails more than what works, and can save a whole bunch of kick in the groin levels of pain down the line.

Anyone with even the most fleeting knowledge of RWD knows that it is still an evolving beast.  For example, although some good temporary solutions exist, no set standard for images exists *insert link* (although this is progressing apace in discussions on the W3C boards).

A RWD project of any magnitude will invariably therefore hit some aspect that hasn't yet been defined in terms of how it should or shouldn't be done.  A great example of this would be to look at how a number of sites have started using off canvas navigations in combination with *insert icon here*.

##Learn as much as you can about how devices render basic styling

When trying to make your website look as close to a native app as posible, you can quickly encounter problems that can be overlooked as rudimentary without enough knowledge of device rendering.

Knowing how mobiles deal with position fixed positioning and potential solutions will crop up time and again, as will how slickly your perfectly crafted transitions and animations perform when viewed on a device with the processing capability of a calculator.

SPLIT THIS OUT - SEPARATE TOPIC

There has been a steady stream of talks and articles lately relating to how we can better reimagine the design process with the new tools at our disposal, and while I agree with the sentiment, there are some fundamental niggles that I just can't shake, specifically relating to RWD.

##Designing in the browser

I'll put my cards on the table right away; I love the idea of designing in the browser.  However, thinking objectively about using it *right now*, there a a couple of massive flaws that need to be addressed before we can start proclaiming it the new messiah.

Andy Budd [spoke for almost every web designer I know](http://www.andybudd.com/archives/2012/03/designing_in_the_browser_is_not_the_answ/) when he said:

'As the best design tools are the ones that put the smallest barrier between the creator and their creation designing in the browser adds an unnecessary level of cruft to the process.'

The level of detail from designing in the browser, doesn't even begin to compare with what can be achieved when letting a good designer loose with their native design tools.  While some might say this level of detail is pointless when we can't always develop to pixel perfection, I would argue the exact opposite point.  Pixel perfection of a design, while not always achievable should *always* be the goal.  As with anything in front-end development, if you water down something from the start, you'll invariably end up with a watered down end product.

The second flaw presumes that all those designing are capable of developing in the browser.  This is a wider debate that has been

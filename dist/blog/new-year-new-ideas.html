			<h1>New Year, New Ideas</h1>

			

<p>Today was the first day of my working New Year and as ever when returning enthusiastic from the holidays (for a few days/hours at least) I&#39;ve got lots of ideas and plans for the next 12 months.</p>
<p>For 2013 I&#39;ve decided not to try and set myself professional goals that seem pretty far removed from where I am right now.  I&#39;ve done this before and invariably I would just end the year having done plenty, but not necessarily around what I&#39;d planned.  Instead, I want to push myself onto achievable paths and just see where they take me. So here are my very open routes I&#39;m going to push myself towards in 2013.</p>
<h2 id="writing">Writing</h2>
<p>This first post marks the start of my first path; I&#39;d like to write a lot more.  When I put this site up a few months ago I had a lot of grand plans for it. Unfortunately, I&#39;ve realised since then that it&#39;s very hard to combine those plans with my day job, writing for publications, outside projects I&#39;m working on and the other things I want to pursue this year. As (Mark)[<a href="https://twitter.com/markboulton/status/288298852317028354">https://twitter.com/markboulton/status/288298852317028354</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/markboulton/status/288299256866013184">https://twitter.com/markboulton/status/288299256866013184</a>] put it today though (great timing btw), there&#39;s something raw I really love about being able to write without having to go through editing, and so I&#39;d be sad to neglect my own blog into irrelevance.</p>
<p>So instead setting aside time to blog like I have been trying (and failing) to do, I&#39;m going to try something different instead; I&#39;m going to write whenever I have something to say, whether that&#39;s like now, straight after work, on the bus/train to work, whenever really. Hopefully some of the smaller posts here might turn into larger articles elsewhere.</p>
<p>The other thing I&#39;m going to stop worrying about on my blog is writing perfection. That&#39;s what has been holding me back from publishing some posts the last few months and that&#39;s one obstacle that&#39;s easily removed by myself. So things might be a little more raw on occasions, but that should mean the site gets a little more love and that&#39;s a decent tradeoff.</p>
<h2 id="speaking">Speaking</h2>
<p>This second path is the biggest one personally for me and the reason I&#39;ve scrapped goals. Both at the start of 2011 and 2012 I made the goal of speaking at a major conference. Probably more out of fear of achieving that goal than anything else, it&#39;s unsurprising that this goal is still sitting on the shelf for now.</p>
<p>Already this year though, I&#39;ve pushed myself (kicking and screaming I should add) onto the beginning of this path. I&#39;ll be speaking at the Ubelly Ignite event later this month and although I&#39;m already slightly terrified, I&#39;m equally as excited. Speaking is something I&#39;ve wanted to try out for what seems like forever and so hopefully this will be the first of many to come this year.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve got plans to speak at some local meet-ups throughout the year, so if you would like me to speak at an event, please do get in contact.</p>
<h2 id="2013">2013</h2>
<p>I&#39;ve got a few exciting things I can&#39;t wait to talk about in the coming months. The project I&#39;m currently working on has been a massive learning curve for me and one that I can&#39;t wait to talk about when the site goes up in a few months.</p>
<p>I also plan to write more for publications this year. As a member of the nUbelly team, I&#39;ll be writing my first articles for them, but that hopefully won&#39;t be the only place I&#39;ll be writing. I&#39;ll be putting up a publications and speaking section on the site shortly - more so I can keep track of things than anything else!</p>
<p>If 2013 can be as exciting professionally for me as 2012 was, then there&#39;s plenty to look forward to.</p>
